Okay, so maybe this can be a permanent readme. Basically, this is a front end to the Nagios REST API

1.3
currently, it can manage its own list of servers and users. To answer a question, no, it can't get user settings, the API doesn't allow for that. I can add users and delete users. (well, you CAN get user status, but all you get is name, user name, user ID, enabled state and email address. I may add that in, I may not, it's not that important.)

What I want to do in 1.4: 
add in host management. DONE

1.5 will be code cleanup to remove redundant code and move some things into popuplists as they should be.


yes, it's written in AppleScriptObjective C. No, I don't particularly care if you like that language, it does what *I* need it to do and that's its only
requirement.
