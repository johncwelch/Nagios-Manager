--step 1 : get a good sized pumpkin

--1.0 goals: to delete users from a nagios server
--1.1 goals: add a local user to a nagios server (make sure to label as "local only, no AD"
     --URL scheme for adding is same as getting info, so no change necessary there, woohoo!
     --hardcode:
          --language: "xi default"
          --date_format: 1
          --number_format: 1
          --use radio buttons for auth_level default to user.
               --if admin selected, all options but read-only are enabled and unchangeable
          --if read_only set to 1, then auth-level is forced to user, only "see all" is changeable, others set to 0
     --all text fields are mandatory
     --when using this, force_pw_change, email_info, monitoring_contact, enable_notifications are always set to 1
     --sans the NSMatrix object, point all "related" radio buttons at the same thing to get them to work "together" properly.
	--BONUS, figured out autoincrementing builds (see the build phases for details)
--step 2: cut pumpkin into wedges about 4" wide and remove pulp
--1.2 goals : build tabbed interface so we can add a server manager (add/remove) tab that's separate from user manager (and other features eventually
--1.3 move from hardcoded server list to user-entered list. This will be fun
--1.4 Get a proper icon and make the menus in the menubar actually do something
--1.5 convert time periods and contacts in new host to pulldowns/popups and see about duplicate code, like grep & json code

--changed from _() to : syntax in function calls
--table columns are not editable. Table size atrib's are all solid bars
--woohoo! don't need a separate get users button, that's handled on load and by changing selection.
--step 3: heat oven to 400 degrees F. No, you're not pre-heating it, don't make me come over there

--BINDINGS NOTES

--array controllers
     (*User Selection: content array bound to user array, which is an empty list. We probably should fix that at some point, but currently causes zero harm. Referencing outlet is userSelection. Referencing bindings are from the user name/ID table. the value for the user name column binds to the array controler, model key path is theUserName, controller key is arranged objects. The user key column binds to the array controller, model key path is theUserID, controller key is arranged objects*)
--step 5: cook pumpkin wedges for about 2 hours, maybe 2.5, skin-side down. If the skin's a bit burnt, that's fine, it comes off easier that way.
--popup lists

	(*Server Table Controller: array controller bound to server array. This is filled from the defaults plist file.
		referencing outlet: theServerTableController
		content array: theSMServerTableControllerArray
		referencing bindings:
			arranged objects.theSMTableServerAPIKey value is server api key column in server table
			arranged objects.theSMTableServerName value is server name
				content value is item 1  in the server selection popup in User manager. This is so that the popup there can use the server name in the prefs
			arranged objects.theSMTableURL value is server url*)

     (*server selection popup list: sent action binds to onSelectedServerName:, content values bind to the server table array controller*)

--pushbuttons

     (*get users button: sent action binds to getServerUsers:*)
     -- THIS HAS BEEN DELETED, BUT KEEPING COMMENT BECAUSE
     --WE MAY NEED TO PUT THIS BACK IN ONE DAY
--Step 6: let pumpkin cool, then cut it out of the skin. I mean, you can do it right away, but it's kind of hot
     (*delete users button: sent action binds to deleteSelectedUsers:*)

     (*the user name/id table: (user table table view) has userTable as its referencing outlet*, user name column binds to theUserName in the user selection array controller. user id column binds to theUserID in the user selection array controller.*)

	--minor comment note: I'm now trying to organize properties by what tab they apply to. So Server Manager, User Manager, etc.
--step 7: Run chunks through a mixer, then pipe the mixer output into a blender. You can skip the mixer, but it makes things a lot easier. basically, you want pumpkin slurry
-- god I hate git. so much

--step 8: other pie ingredients. This is per batch, each batch makes about 1.8 pies - 2 eggs, 1 3/4 cups pumpkin, 3/4ths cup brown sugar
	--1 1/2 cups sweetened condensed milk. I just used the whole 14 oz. can, it's fine. It's pie, not souffle. 1/2 tsp salt
